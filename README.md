# My Neovim Config

Just my (fairly lightwieght) configuration for the  neovim.
It's nothing very special but something I've been working on quite heavily 
over the past few months.


## Planned Changes
 - Add LSP configuration
 - Fix issue with Drex and loading of session files
 - Add autoformatting (most likely using Prettier, or just existing vim tools)
	to automatically narrow text to be 80 characters wide
 - Improve support for staging indivdual files (with Fugitive)
